DCPython Website
================

About
-----
The site is built with the `Django web framework <http://www.djangoproject.org>`_. The two major advantages of Django are it gives us an admin site out of the box and many people already know it.

We use **Git version control** and `GitHub <http://www.github.com>`_ for project hosting. Github provides git hosting, bug tracking and wiki.

We use the `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`_ development environment. Vagrant allows us to standardize our development and production environments and makes it easy for everybody to get up and running. Vagrant creates a virtual machine, sets up django, database, and everything, then mirrors and syncs the project source code on both your machine and the vm. That way, you make changes to the code on your machine, the changes are mirrored in the vm. Then you run Django on the VM. Now, you can do local development, but you don't have to set up Django and the Database. Very cool.


Installation
------------

You will need to install:

- `VirtualBox <http://www.virtualbox.org>`_ (I found that I needed to restart my computer to get VirtualBox working properly)
- `Vagrant 1.3.4 <http://www.vagrantup.com>`_ (you cannot use ubuntu package - too old)

Create a `GitHub <http://www.github.com>`_ account.

While signed into github, go to https://github.com/DCPython/dcpython-django and click the "fork" button. This will create a fork (or copy) of the dcpython-django application in your github account.

From the commandline
++++++++++++++++++++

Clone your copy of github repository to your working directory (replace <your-username> with  your github username)::

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/dcpython-django.git
    $ cd dcpython-django

Install Vagrant caching plugin::

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier

Start the vagrant environment::

    $ vagrant up

YOU WILL GET HUGE RED ERRORS: check to ensure this is a permissions issue with postgres, then continue with these instructions
TODO - please help me fix this bug!

Log into the vagrant vm::

    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd /vagrant
    $ sh config_db.sh

Start the django server::

    $ foreman start

You can now visit the Django site at http://localhost:5000

Basic Vagrant
-------------

From the dcpython-django directory
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a new development environment::

    $ vagrant up

Destroy the development environment::

    $ vagrant destroy

Log into the development environment::

    $ vagrant ssh

From the vagrant ssh command line
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Start django::

    $ cd /vagrant
    $ foreman start

Django manage.py::

    $ cd /vagrant
    $ ./manage.py <params>

You can visit the django site at http://localhost:5000

Basic Git
---------

We will be using this git branching model: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Start New Feature
+++++++++++++++++

Merge any changes from master::

    $ git pull https://github.com/DCPython/dcpython-django.git

List all the changes in this branch::

    $ git log

Create a new feature branch in which to make changes::

    $ git checkout -b "descriptive-name-of-branch"

List branches::

    $ git branch

Switch to another branch::

    $ git checkout "name-of-branch"

View status of your files (which have changed, which are staged for commit)::

    $ git status

Add files to be committed::

    $ git add name-of-file

Commit changes::

    $ git commit

.. Note:: you must add a commit message. first line short title (~50 characters); skip line; detailed description of changes

Merge Feature
+++++++++++++

Merge any changes from master that have occurred while you were programming::

    $ git pull https://github.com/DCPython/dcpython-django.git

Push changes to your github repo::

    $ git push -u origin name-of-branch

Now, go to github, select the branch you just pushed from the drop-down, then click "pull request" to request your changes be merged with master.

Deployment
----------

Heroku is generously donating servers. Rackspace is generously donating storage/static file serve.

On Heroku:
 * `dcpython-develop` - the test server
 * `dcpython` - the production server

You must set up your repository in order to deploy:

1. Install Heroku toolbelt: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/
2. ``git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:dcpython.git``
3. ``git remote add forked git@heroku.com:dcpython-develop.git``

To deploy to dev environment:

1. ``git push forked master``
2. ``heroku run python manage.py migrate -a dcpython-develop``

To deploy to production:

1. ``git push heroku master``
2. ``heroku run python manage.py migrate -a dcpython``
